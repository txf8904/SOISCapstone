        <h2>Past</h2>
        <h3>
            Twenty years ago, there was a serial murder in the small town of Tenais.
            According to the investigation, the nine victims were from the same underground organization.
            The last victim was found shooting herself under a statue of the Virgin.
            There are some rumors that say he died because he could not accept the successive deaths 
            of his companions, and some say that he was the one who killed all the others. <br><br>
            In fact, not many people care about the truth of the matter. 
            The case has not been finalized because of a lack of evidence. 
            Seems nobody cares about this case anymore, until the next round of serial murder started. 
        </h3>

        <h1> </h1>
        <h2>Now</h2>
        <h3>
            You never know what tomorrow will bring, but you never imagine one day you will back to 
            your hometown, a place you try to escape since you were a child. 
            You were "promoted" to Tenais as the new detective in town. 
            On the first day of your arrival, one homicide happened, then second, and third...<br><br>
            As the investigation progresses gets deeper and deeper, 
            the serial killing seems are connected with the past. More, it seems to connect with you, your past.
